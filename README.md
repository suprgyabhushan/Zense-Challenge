##Synopsis of the Challenge

To make a sorting numbers program using HTML only.

##Explanation of the Code

1. I linked the HTML file where I made the textboxes and the C code through CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripting...

2. First I installed the Apache2 on my ubuntu and then enabled CGI on my Apache2.....I need to save my files and folders in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/  folder.

3. I made a HTML form named sort.html where I linked the file with my C code (by putting action attribute as http:// 192.16.114.56(Any Wifi IP Address)/cgi-bin/sort.c .

4. The C file is made completely in C language.....with some CGI scripting done for HTML part .

5. It is doing everything as the challenge said but for a set of particular text boxes....You need to insert more number of textboxes if you want to sort more numbers....The problem is that every text box in HTML has a unique name...Also I cannot apply loop in HTML(I thought by doing VBscript But no success)...

Hope to get more advancements!!!!
